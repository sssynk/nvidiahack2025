## 📍 Location

**File:** `/Users/josuediaz/nvidiahack2025/ui/src/app/settings/page.tsx`

---

## 🎨 UI Changes

### Before:
```
LLM provider:
○ NVIDIA (default) — Nemotron
○ Groq — openai/gpt-oss-20b
```

### After:
```
LLM provider:
○ NVIDIA — Nemotron (free tier)
○ OpenAI — GPT-4o/GPT-4o-mini (currently active)
○ Groq — openai/gpt-oss-20b (fast)
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### 1. Updated TypeScript Types
```typescript
// Before
const [llmProvider, setLlmProvider] = useState<"nvidia" | "groq">("nvidia");

// After
const [llmProvider, setLlmProvider] = useState<"nvidia" | "groq" | "openai">("nvidia");
```

### 2. Enhanced Provider Detection
```typescript
// Now properly detects and sets OpenAI
if (prov === "openai") {
  setLlmProvider("openai");
} else if (prov === "groq") {
  setLlmProvider("groq");
} else {
  setLlmProvider("nvidia");
}
```

### 3. Added OpenAI Radio Button
```tsx
<RadioGroupItem id="llm-openai" value="openai" />
<Label htmlFor="llm-openai">
  OpenAI — GPT-4o/GPT-4o-mini (currently active)
</Label>
```

### 4. Updated Help Text
```
OpenAI requires OPENAI_API_KEY env. 
Groq requires GROQ_API_KEY env. 
Configure server-side.
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### User Flow:

1. **Navigate to Settings**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Click on Settings (gear icon or settings link)

2. **See Current Provider**
   - The currently active provider is shown as selected
   - "OpenAI" option now visible

3. **Switch Providers**
   - Select OpenAI radio button
   - Click "Save"
   - Backend updates the LLM_PROVIDER environment variable
   - All future AI operations use OpenAI

4. **Immediate Effect**
   - Summaries use selected provider
   - Q&A chat uses selected provider
   - No app restart needed!

---

## 🔄 Integration with Backend

### Backend Already Supports This!

The backend API (`api.py`) already had OpenAI validation:

```python
if prov not in ("nvidia", "groq", "openai"):
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="...")
```

So the UI toggle **immediately works** with the existing backend!

## 💡 Current Configuration

Based on your terminal logs, you're currently using:
- **LLM Provider**: OpenAI ✅
- **Model**: gpt-4o-mini ✅
- **API Key**: Configured ✅

The settings page will now show **OpenAI as selected** when you visit it!

---

## 🧪 Test It

1. **Open Settings Page:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/settings
   ```

2. **You should see:**
   - ✅ OpenAI option available
   - ✅ OpenAI currently selected (since it's running)
   - ✅ Can switch between NVIDIA, OpenAI, Groq

3. **Try switching:**
   - Select different provider
   - Click Save
   - Upload a new PDF
   - See it use the new provider for summarization!

## 📊 Provider Comparison in UI

| Provider | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **NVIDIA** | Nemotron (free tier) | Available if API key set |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o/GPT-4o-mini | ✅ Currently Active |
