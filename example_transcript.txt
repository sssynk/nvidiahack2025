In today's lecture, we covered the fundamentals of machine learning.

We started with supervised learning, where the algorithm learns from labeled data. The main types are classification and regression. Classification predicts categories, while regression predicts continuous values.

For example, predicting whether an email is spam or not spam is a classification problem. Predicting house prices is a regression problem.

Next, we discussed unsupervised learning, which finds patterns in unlabeled data. Common techniques include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

Clustering groups similar data points together. K-means is a popular clustering algorithm. Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA help visualize high-dimensional data.

We also touched on the importance of data preprocessing:
- Handling missing values
- Normalizing features to the same scale
- Encoding categorical variables

Key takeaways:
1. Always split your data into training and test sets to avoid overfitting
2. Feature engineering is crucial for model performance
3. Start simple before trying complex models
4. Cross-validation helps ensure your model generalizes well

The bias-variance tradeoff is fundamental. High bias leads to underfitting, high variance leads to overfitting. We need to find the right balance.

Common metrics for evaluation:
- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Regression: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared

Homework: Implement a linear regression model on the housing dataset. Use scikit-learn and submit your Jupyter notebook by Friday.

Next class, we'll dive into neural networks and deep learning fundamentals.
